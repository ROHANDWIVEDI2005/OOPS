Binding is the process of connecting an identifier in your code—like a variable name or a function call—to its actual address or definition in memory. In C++, binding can happen in two ways:

1.)Early (static) binding
>>>>>The compiler resolves the address at compile time. You get direct, fast calls but no run‑time flexibility.

2.)Late (dynamic) binding
>>>>>The compiler inserts a lookup (via the v‑table) so that the exact function is chosen at run time. This enables polymorphism (virtual‑function calls) at the cost of a small performance overhead.


>When the decision happens:
Early binding: at compile time. The compiler fixes each call to a specific function address.

Late binding: at run time. The program looks up the function address in a v‑table when the call actually executes.

>Applies to:
Early binding: normal (non‑virtual) functions and variables.

Late binding: only virtual functions.

>Performance:
Early binding: fastest—no extra lookup.

Late binding: a bit slower—performs an indirect lookup through the v‑table.
>Flexibility (polymorphism):
Early binding: static behavior—you always call the base‑class version if you use a base pointer.

Late binding: dynamic behavior—you call the most derived override based on the actual object type.
