### Encapsulation

- In OOPs encapsulation is implemented using classes and access specifiers that keeps the data, and the manipulating methods enclosed inside a single unit.

- The direct advantage of this packaging is that only the required components are visible to the user, and other information is hidden.

- There may be cases where you need to access or modify the private members such as name. This can be done by using getter and setter methods:

- Getters and Setters are part of data encapsulation used to protect our data, particularly when creating classes. These are public methods that are used to access and modify the private or protected members of a class.
