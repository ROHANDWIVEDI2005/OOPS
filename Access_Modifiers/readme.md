## Acess Modifiers

**Access modifiers or access specifiers in a class are used to assign the accessibility to the class members, i.e., they set some restrictions on the class members so that they canâ€™t be directly accessed by the outside functions.** 

`Access modifiers are used to implement an important aspect of Object-Oriented Programming known as Data Hiding.`

### There are 3 types of access modifiers available in C++:

- Public
- Private (default)
- Protected
