Stack Unwinding is the process of removing function call frames from function call stack at run time. The local objects are destroyed in reverse order in which they were constructed.

Stack Unwinding occur when a function returns a value or due to exception handling in C++. 


Note:
Always catch exceptions by reference (catch (const MyError& e)) to avoid slicing and unnecessary copies.
Reserve throw for genuine errors, not ordinary control flowâ€”exceptions can be expensive and obscure normal logic.
