We can create virtual functions with the default values if  values are passed during function call then the default values are overriden and become parameterized argument.


1.)Function Overriding Basics
When a derived class has a function with the same name and parameters as a base class, it overrides the base class function.

2.)What Happens with Default Arguments?

Default arguments (like int x = 5) are handled at compile time.

This means the compiler fills in the default value when it sees a missing argument during the function call.

3.)Function Signature

A functionâ€™s signature includes its name and parameter types, but not the default values.

So, even if the base class has fun(int x = 5) and the derived class has fun(int x), their signatures are considered the same.

This allows overriding to happen.

4.)Which Function Is Called?

If you call fun() on a derived class object without an argument, the default value from the base class is used.

But the function from the derived class is actually called at run-time
