Only copies the pointer address, not the actual data.

Both objects point to the same memory.

Dangerous! Changes in one object affect the other.

Shallow Copy means that only the pointers will be copied not the actual resources that the pointers are pointing to. This can lead to dangling pointers(a pointer that points to a memory location that has been deallocated earlier in the program) if the original object is deleted.
