- A parameterized constructor in C++ is simply a constructor that accepts one or more arguments, allowing you to initialize an object with specific values at the moment of its creation. 
- Unlike a default constructor (which takes no arguments), a parameterized constructor enables fine‑grained control over each new object’s initial state.

- No return type is specified (not even void).

- As soon as you define ​any​ constructor, the compiler will not generate a default (zero‑argument) constructor for you.
