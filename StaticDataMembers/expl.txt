Static data members are class members that are declared using static keywords.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features of Static Data Members:
1.)âœ… Only One Copy
Only one copy exists for all objects of the class. Every object shares it.

2.)ðŸ•’ Created Before Any Object
It is created even before any object of that class is created.

3.)ðŸ”’ Access Control
Its visibility depends on whether it's public, private, or protected.

4.)ðŸ§  Program Lifetime
It lives as long as the program runs.
 
5.) We can aslo assign a class or object to the static data members and access thier function using dot operator.
Syntax:
Declaring inside the class:

    static data_type variable_name;
};
