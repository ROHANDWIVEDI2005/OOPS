// ðŸ”¹ Step-by-Step Explanation:
// 1. setNumber
// This is the type of the static member s. Think of it like a class or structure.
// 2. b::x
// This is how we refer to the static variable x that belongs to class b.The b::part means "this variable is a member of class b".
// 3. = setNumber(11);
// This is creating a new object of type setNumber with the value 30 passed to its constructor.
// Now x is a static member of class b, and it is initialized with a new object of type setNumber. This means that x will hold an object of type setNumber, and you can access its members using the dot operator.
setNumber b::x = setNumber(30); // Definition and initialization of static data member
int main(){
  cout<<"Accessing the static data members without creating the object of class A"<<endl;
  cout<<A::x<<endl; // Accessing static data member using class name
  cout<<"---------------------------------------------------------"<<endl;
  cout<<"Accessing the static data members using object of class A"<<endl;
  A a; // Creating object of class A
  cout<<a.x<<endl;

  b b1; // Creating object of class b
