Once the file is opened in the write mode using either fstream or ofstream, we can perform the write operation in similar way as with cout using << operator.

Opening Mode 
ios::out	-> File open for writing: the internal stream buffer supports output operations.
Syntax:
fstream fileout("file.txt", ios::out);

These modes can also be combined using OR operator (|). For example, you can open the file stream in both read and write mode as shown:
fstream str("file.txt", ios::in | ios::out);
If the file opened in write mode does not exists, a new file is created. But if the file opened in read mode doesn't exists, then no new file is created, and an exception is thrown

ifstream: Stands for input file stream. It is equivalent to open fstream in ios::in mode.
ofstream: Stands for output file stream. It is equivalent to opening fstream in ios::out mode.
