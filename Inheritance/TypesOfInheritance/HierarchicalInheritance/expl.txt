Hierarchical inheritance simply means “one base class, many derived classes.”

Base class (parent) defines some common properties or functions.
Derived classes (children) each inherit those properties/functions, and can add their own.
You end up with a tree: one root, multiple branches.

      A        ← base class  
     / \  
    B   C     ← two derived classes
